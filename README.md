## About

Text Summary is a process of abstracting the important information for source document and finding important sentences from it to generate summary so that text can give us the idea of entire document. Our work involves summarizing the scientific research paper.The method for summarizing include unsupervised extractive text summarization.The end result that we will generate include a summary generator which reduces the tedious task of searching and summarizing the research paper.The purpose of this synopsis is to document the details of literature survey,Software Project Management plan (SPMP) document,software Requirements Specification (SRS) document,Software Design Document(SDD) and software test document(STD) for the application that we are developing for generating the summary of the research paper. This synopsis introduces us with the implementation of summary generator using unsupervised extractive text summarization which gives better results as compared to abstractive summarization methods.
